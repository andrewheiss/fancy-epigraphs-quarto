# Fancy Quarto epigraphs

This extension provides a shortcode for including nicely typeset [epigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraph_(literature)) in Quarto documents.

This text:

```qmd
{{{< epigraph "Do or do not. There is no try." source="Yoda" >}}}
```

â€¦will appear like this:

![](README_img/yoda-alone.png)

This works in all formats. In HTML, Typst PDFs, and LaTeX PDFs there is special styling to make everything left-aligned-within-a-right-aligned box; in all other formats, epigraphs appear as standard blockquotes. [See below](#using) for more details.

## Installing

Run this terminal command to install the shortcode in your Quarto project:

```bash
quarto add andrewheiss/fancy-epigraphs-quarto
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory. If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

### Shortcode

Basic epigraph:

```qmd
{{{< epigraph "Do or do not. There is no try." source="Yoda" >}}}
```

Epigraph with markdown formatting in the quote and/or source:

```qmd
{{{< epigraph "Do or **do not**. There *is* no try." source="~~Grogu~~Yoda" >}}}
```

Epigraph without a source:

```qmd
{{{< epigraph "Do or do not. There is no try." source="Yoda" >}}}
```

### HTML-specific options

The rendered HTML follows [Bootstrap's semantic structure for blockquotes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/#naming-a-source). I include it in a `div` with some additional Bootstrap CSS classes to make the text left-aligned within a right-aligned block that takes up 50% of the page width, resulting in HTML like this:

```html
<div class="epigraph-wrapper clearfix">
  <figure class="text-end w-50 float-end">
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p>Do or do not. There is no try.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">
      Yoda
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
```

You can adjust the CSS however you want based on these classes. As an example, `_extensions/epigraph/epigraph.css` will disable the left border that Bootstrap includes on blockquote elements by default.

You can either include your own custom epigraph CSS settings:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    css: whatever.css
```

or you can use the `epigraph-html` format, which is the regular HTML format but with `_extensions/epigraph/epigraph.css` included automatically:

```yaml
format:
  epigraph-html: default
```

### PDF/LaTeX-specific options

Epigraphs are typset using the `\epigraph{}{}` command, which means you must enable [the epigraph package](https://ctan.org/pkg/epigraph?lang=en). You can do this using the `epigraph-pdf` format, which inserts `_extensions/epigraph/epigraph.tex` automatically:

```yaml
format:
  epigraph-pdf: default
```

Or you can use the regular PDF format and insert whatever settings you want:

```yaml
format:
  pdf:
    include-in-header: 
      text: |
        \usepackage{epigraph}
        \setlength{\epigraphrule}{0em}
        \setlength{\beforeepigraphskip}{-2em}
        \setlength{\afterepigraphskip}{1em}
```

### Typst-specific options

There's nothing special to do for typst. Epigraphs will be typeset like this:

```typst
#{
  show quote: set align(left)
  show quote: set pad(left: 65%, right: 0em)
  
  quote(
    block: true,
    attribution: [Yoda]
  )[Do or do not. There is no try.]
}
```

### Other formats

All other formats (Word, revealjs, Markdown, whatever) will typeset the epigraph as if it had been written like this:

```default
> Quote to include
> 
> ---Source
```

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal example: [`minimal-example.qmd`](minimal-example.qmd).

And here's a fully annotated example: [`example.qmd`](example.qmd). It looks like this when rendered:

- LaTeX: [`example-latex.pdf`](example-latex.pdf)
- Typst: [`example-typst.pdf`](example-typst.pdf)
- Markdown: [`example.md`](example.md)
